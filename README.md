This is the first-website I ever created. I made it for the Program.it computer sciece event at Lower Merion High School. The Program seeks to increase enrollment of Black and Hispanic students in computer science courses. After hosting program.it for two consecutive years, the enrollment of Blacks and Hispanics in computer science courses at Lower Merion High School increased by over 400%. The website is yet to be published for our third installation of the event in January 2022. Check out the website @ https://princegeutler.github.io/Program.it/index.html
